## Special Notes
CiliaQ_Preparator offers the segmentation method "CANNY 3D". This function was implemented based on code from the ImageJ plugin [canny3d-thresholder](https://github.com/sRassmann/canny3d-thresholder) version [v0.1.0](https://github.com/sRassmann/canny3d-thresholder/releases/tag/0.1.0).

Some functions (Hysteresis thresholding, Canny3D) in CiliaQ_Preparator require additional installation of the 3D ImageJ Suite to your FIJI / ImageJ distribution. How to install this 3D ImageJ Suite is explained in the installation instructions for CiliaQ at the CiliaQ wiki: https://github.com/hansenjn/CiliaQ/wiki/Installing-CiliaQ .
