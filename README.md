## Special Notes
CiliaQ_Preparator offers the segmentation method "CANNY 3D". This function was implemented based on code from the ImageJ plugin [canny3d-thresholder](https://github.com/sRassmann/canny3d-thresholder) version [v0.1.0](https://github.com/sRassmann/canny3d-thresholder/releases/tag/0.1.0).

Some functions (Hysteresis thresholding, Canny3D) in CiliaQ_Preparator require additional installation of the ['3D ImageJ Suite'](https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/start) to your FIJI / ImageJ distribution. To install the 3D ImageJ Suite, download the [core libary](https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/_media/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/mcib3d-core-3.96.jar) and the [plugin](https://imagejdocu.tudor.lu/_media/plugin/stacks/3d_ij_suite/mcib3d_plugins-3.96.jar) from 3D ImageJ Suite's download section and install them to your FIJI / ImageJ by drag and drop into the FIJI / ImageJ window.
